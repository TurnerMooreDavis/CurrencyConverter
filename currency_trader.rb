# Build a third class called CurrencyTrader. CurrencyTrader should be initialized with two CurrencyConverter objects from two different points in time, plus a starting Currency. CurrencyTrader should have a method which returns the best currency investment over that span of time.
#
# For instance, if you are starting with $1,000,000, assume that you can convert your dollars to one currency at the first point in time, but that you must then convert it back to dollars at the second point in time. The best bet given two CurrencyConverters may be GBP. If USD -> GBP is 1 to 1 at the first point in time, then 1 to 0.5 at the second point in time, you can double your money.
#
# You should not need to modify Currency or CurrencyConverter to get this to work, but if you see a path that involves modifying them and want to give it a shot, feel free.
